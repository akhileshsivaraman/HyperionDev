# Capstone 4
<br>
A stock-taking programme for a hypothetical warehouse created for the HyperionDev Software Engineering course.
<br>

### Installation
In this repository, you will find two files:
<br>
* inventory.py - the stock-taking programme
* inventory.txt - a dataset that can be used to run the programme
<br>

### Using the programme
When you run `inventory.py`, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to do the following operations:
<br>
* add a new product to the stock
* view all products in the warehouse
* search for products by code
* determine the product with the lowest stock and re-stock
* determine the product with the highest stock
* calculate the total stock value of each product
